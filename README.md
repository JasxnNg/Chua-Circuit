# Chua Circuit

This is a simulation of a Chua Circuit in Python; this simulation assumes the circuit has no inductance and the wires have negligible resistance. Use ``simulation.py`` to see a plot of the circuit values in the xyz plane. Use ``randomtest.py`` to check how the sum of the xyz values are randomly distributed. The file ``circuitsim.py`` contains code that you can put in vPython to view as another simulation.
